# 🚨 URGENT ACTION REQUIRED!

## ❌ CRITICAL ISSUE

**Your backend is NOT deployed!**

**Current Version:** v5.0.0  
**Required Version:** v5.0.5  
**Status:** 5 versions behind!

---

## 🎯 WHY NOTHING IS WORKING

**All your issues are because backend v5.0.5 is not deployed:**

1. ❌ Colony waste not accumulating → Fix is in v5.0.5
2. ❌ Analytics page crashing → Fix is in v5.0.5
3. ❌ User colony assignment → Endpoint is in v5.0.5
4. ❌ Collector stats not updating → Fix is in v5.0.5

**ALL FIXES ARE IN CODE BUT NOT RUNNING!**

### Step 1: Manual Deploy Backend

### Step 2: Run Fix Script
