# üîÑ Backfill Colony Points & Waste Guide

## What This Does

This migration will:
1. **Backfill Colony Points** - Add all historical user points to their colonies
2. **Backfill Colony Waste** - Recalculate colony waste from all historical classifications

For user 'lol' with ~600 points, this will add those 600 points to colony 1!

---

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Wait for Deployment (2-3 minutes)

Check if v5.6.0 is deployed:
```
https://smartwaste360-backend.onrender.com
```

Should show: **v5.6.0** with "BACKFILL-COLONY-POINTS-AND-WASTE"

---

### Step 2: Check Current Status (Optional)

See current colony points before migration:
```
https://smartwaste360-backend.onrender.com/api/migration/migration-status
```

This shows:
- Current colony points
- Sum of all user points in each colony
- Current waste amounts

---

### Step 3: Run Colony Points Backfill

**Method 1: Using Browser (Simple)**

You can't use GET in browser for POST endpoints, so use curl or Postman.

**Method 2: Using PowerShell (Recommended)**

Open PowerShell and run:
```powershell
curl -X POST https://smartwaste360-backend.onrender.com/api/migration/backfill-colony-points
```

**Method 3: Using Command Prompt**

```cmd
curl -X POST https://smartwaste360-backend.onrender.com/api/migration/backfill-colony-points
```

---

### Step 4: Check the Results

The response will show:
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Colony points backfilled successfully",
  "users_processed": 1,
  "colonies_updated": 1,
  "colony_details": [
    {
      "colony_id": 1,
      "colony_name": "Your Colony",
      "new_total_points": 625,
      "points_added": 600,
      "users_count": 1,
      "users": [
        {
          "user_id": 2,
          "username": "lol",
          "points": 600
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

---

### Step 5: Run Colony Waste Backfill (Optional)

This recalculates colony waste from all historical classifications:

```powershell
curl -X POST https://smartwaste360-backend.onrender.com/api/migration/backfill-colony-waste
```

This will show how much plastic, paper, metal, etc. the colony has accumulated from all past classifications.

---

### Step 6: Verify in App

1. Go to your app: https://smartwaste360-frontend.vercel.app/
2. Go to **Leaderboard** tab
3. Colony 1 should now show **~625 points** (600 from backfill + 25 from recent test)

---

## What Each Endpoint Does

### `/api/migration/backfill-colony-points` (POST)
- Adds all user points to their respective colonies
- Safe to run multiple times (adds points each time, so only run once!)
- Shows detailed breakdown of which users contributed how many points

### `/api/migration/backfill-colony-waste` (POST)
- Recalculates colony waste from all waste_logs
- Safe to run multiple times (overwrites with correct totals)
- Shows breakdown by waste category

### `/api/migration/migration-status` (GET)
- Shows current colony stats
- Compares colony points vs sum of user points
- Helps verify if migration is needed

---

## Important Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Run backfill-colony-points only ONCE!**
- It ADDS points, not sets them
- Running twice will double the points
- If you accidentally run twice, you'll need to manually subtract

‚úÖ **backfill-colony-waste is safe to run multiple times**
- It SETS the waste amounts based on calculations
- Always gives correct totals

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Method Not Allowed"
**Cause:** Trying to access POST endpoint via browser GET request

**Solution:** Use curl or Postman with POST method

### Issue: Points doubled
**Cause:** Ran backfill-colony-points twice

**Solution:** Manually subtract the extra points or reset colony points to 0 and run once

### Issue: No users found
**Cause:** No users have points or colony_id

**Solution:** Check migration-status to see user data

---

## Quick Commands

**Check status:**
```bash
curl https://smartwaste360-backend.onrender.com/api/migration/migration-status
```

**Backfill points (PowerShell):**
```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://smartwaste360-backend.onrender.com/api/migration/backfill-colony-points" -Method POST
```

**Backfill waste (PowerShell):**
```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://smartwaste360-backend.onrender.com/api/migration/backfill-colony-waste" -Method POST
```

---

## Expected Results

**Before Migration:**
- Colony 1: 25 points (from recent test)
- User 'lol': 600 points

**After Migration:**
- Colony 1: 625 points (600 backfilled + 25 from test)
- User 'lol': still 600 points (unchanged)
- Leaderboard shows colony with 625 points
