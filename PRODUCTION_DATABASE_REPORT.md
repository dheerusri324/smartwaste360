## 🎯 Root Cause

**The production database had persistent data from previous deployments that was never cleared.**

1. **Old Bookings:** Data from Oct 13 (14 days ago) was still in the database
2. **Corrupted Data:** Some bookings had invalid collector IDs (e.g., "metal" instead of "COL001")
3. **No Auto-Cleanup:** The database persists between deployments on Render
4. **Frontend Cache:** Your frontend was correctly loading v3.0.1, but fetching old data from the backend

---

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### Diagnostic System (v4.1.0)
Created a 5-expert team diagnostic system with endpoints:

1. **Full Diagnostic:** `/api/database-debug/full-diagnostic`
   - Analyzes schema, data integrity, performance, migrations, and production data

2. **Fix Schema:** `/api/database-debug/fix-missing-columns`
   - Automatically adds missing columns

3. **Clear Old Data:** `/api/database-debug/clear-old-data`
   - Removes data older than 7 days

4. **Clear All Bookings:** `/api/database-debug/clear-all-bookings`
   - Fresh start (use with caution)

### PowerShell Scripts Created
- `diagnose-production.ps1` - Run full diagnostic
- `final-cleanup.ps1` - Interactive cleanup
- `test-booking-data.ps1` - Check database state
- `check-bookings-table.ps1` - Verify deployment
