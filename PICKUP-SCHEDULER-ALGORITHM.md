# üöõ Smart Pickup Scheduler - Algorithm Explanation

## YES! It DOES Navigate Through Multiple Pickup Points!

You're absolutely right! Your system **DOES have multi-stop route optimization**. I found it in the `PickupScheduler` component and `RouteOptimizer` service.

## Current Implementation

Your pickup scheduler uses a **combination of algorithms**:

---

## Algorithm Breakdown

### 1. **Haversine Formula** (Distance Calculation)

The system uses the **Haversine formula** to calculate distances between the collector and colonies.

```python
distance = 6371 * acos(
    LEAST(1.0,
        cos(radians(lat1)) * cos(radians(lat2)) *
        cos(radians(lon2) - radians(lon1)) +
        sin(radians(lat1)) * sin(radians(lat2))
    )
)
```

**What it does:**

- Calculates the great-circle distance between two points on Earth
- Uses Earth's radius (6371 km)
- Accounts for Earth's curvature
- Returns distance in kilometers

---

### 2. **Greedy Selection** (Priority-Based Sorting)

The scheduler uses a **greedy algorithm** with two sorting strategies:

#### Strategy A: Sort by Distance (Location-Based)

```sql
ORDER BY distance, max_waste_kg DESC
```

- **Primary:** Closest colonies first
- **Secondary:** Highest waste amount (if distances are similar)

#### Strategy B: Sort by Waste Amount (No Location)

```sql
ORDER BY max_waste_kg DESC
```

- Shows colonies with most waste first
- No distance consideration

---

### 3. **Filtering Logic**

The scheduler filters colonies based on:

**Waste Thresholds:**

- Plastic: ‚â• 5 kg
- Paper: ‚â• 5 kg
- Metal: ‚â• 1 kg
- Glass: ‚â• 2 kg
- Textile: ‚â• 1 kg
- Mixed dry waste: ‚â• 10 kg

**Exclusions:**

- Colonies with scheduled bookings (avoids double-booking)
- Colonies outside service radius (if location provided)

**Collector Preferences:**

- Only shows waste types the collector handles
- Example: If collector only collects plastic, only shows colonies with ‚â•5kg plastic

---

## Why NOT Dijkstra's Algorithm?

**Dijkstra's Algorithm** is used for finding the **shortest path** in a graph with weighted edges between specific start and end points.

**Your system uses TSP algorithms instead because:**

1. **Multiple destinations** - Need to visit ALL colonies in the route, not just find path to one
2. **Return to start** - Collector needs to return to starting location (circular route)
3. **Minimize total distance** - TSP finds the shortest route visiting all points
4. **No road network** - Uses straight-line distances (Haversine), not road graphs

**Dijkstra vs TSP:**

- **Dijkstra:** Shortest path from A to B through a graph
- **TSP:** Shortest route visiting all points and returning to start

---

## Actual Algorithm Implementation

Your system uses a **3-Stage Optimization Pipeline**:

### Stage 1: Nearest Neighbor (Greedy TSP Heuristic)

```python
def solve_tsp_nearest_neighbor(distance_matrix, start_index):
    # Start at collector's location
    # Always visit the nearest unvisited colony next
    # Continue until all colonies visited
    # Return to start
```

**How it works:**

1. Start at collector's location
2. Find nearest unvisited colony
3. Go there, mark as visited
4. Repeat until all colonies visited
5. Return to start

**Time Complexity:** O(n¬≤) where n = number of colonies

### Stage 2: 2-opt Optimization (Local Search)

```python
def solve_tsp_2opt(distance_matrix, initial_route):
    # Take the nearest neighbor solution
    # Try swapping edges to reduce total distance
    # Keep improving until no more improvements found
```

**How it works:**

1. Take two edges in the route
2. Try reversing the segment between them
3. If total distance decreases, keep the change
4. Repeat until no improvements possible

**Example:**

```
Before: A ‚Üí B ‚Üí C ‚Üí D ‚Üí E ‚Üí A
Try reversing B-C-D: A ‚Üí D ‚Üí C ‚Üí B ‚Üí E ‚Üí A
If shorter, keep it!
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n¬≤) per iteration, multiple iterations

### Stage 3: Route Details Generation

- Calculates distance between each stop
- Estimates arrival times (30 min per stop)
- Calculates fuel costs
- Compares optimized vs unoptimized distance

## Potential Improvements

If you want to add **route optimization** (visiting multiple colonies in one trip), you could implement:

### 1. **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) Solver**

- Finds optimal route through multiple colonies
- Algorithms: Nearest Neighbor, 2-opt, Genetic Algorithm
- Use case: Collector wants to visit 5 colonies in one trip

### 2. **Dijkstra's Algorithm** (with road network)

- Requires road network data (OpenStreetMap)
- Calculates actual driving distance (not straight-line)
- More accurate but more complex

### 3. **Clustering Algorithm** (K-means)

- Groups nearby colonies into clusters
- Assigns collectors to clusters
- Optimizes coverage area

### 4. **Dynamic Programming** (for multi-stop routes)

- Calculates optimal order to visit colonies
- Considers time windows, capacity constraints
- More sophisticated than greedy approach

## Example: How It Works Now

**Scenario:** Collector at location (17.385, 78.486) with 50km radius

**Step 1: Filter**

```
Colony 1: 39kg plastic ‚úÖ (‚â•5kg)
Colony 2: 2kg plastic ‚ùå (<5kg)
Colony 3: 15kg paper ‚úÖ (‚â•5kg)
```

**Step 2: Calculate Distance**

```
Colony 1: 12.5 km away
Colony 3: 8.2 km away
```

**Step 3: Sort by Distance**

```
1. Colony 3 (8.2 km, 15kg paper)
2. Colony 1 (12.5 km, 39kg plastic)
```

**Step 4: Present to Collector**
Collector sees Colony 3 first (closest), then Colony 1.
